# C_elegans_Simulink
An integrated neuromechanical model for the nematode, C. elegans,  which is modeled by Jordan H. Boyle (Boyle et al., 2012).

## Overview
An integrated neuromechanical model for the nematode, C. elegans,  which is modeled by Jordan H. Boyle (Boyle et al., 2012).
This nematode model is ported in MATLAB Simulink, which is verified in MATLAB R2018a.
